The GHOST of the late king, Hamlet’s father.

GERTRUDE, the Queen, Hamlet’s mother, now wife of Claudius.

HORATIO, Friend to Hamlet.

Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,

His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life,

 Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius,

Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death

But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—

Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,

’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,

Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.

This gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet

 [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]

For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,

So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,

As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

 Enter Hamlet, Horatio and Marcellus.

That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee Hamlet,

 [_Ghost beckons Hamlet._]

 [_Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet._]

 Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.

O Hamlet, what a falling off was there,

Adieu, adieu, adieu. Hamlet, remember me.

[_Within._] Lord Hamlet.

And what so poor a man as Hamlet is

Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac’d,

Of Hamlet’s transformation; so I call it,

And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.

Came this from Hamlet to her?

‘Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.

 Enter Hamlet, reading.

How does my good Lord Hamlet?

You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.

For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,

Of Hamlet’s wildness: so shall I hope your virtues

 Enter Hamlet.

You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said,

 Enter Hamlet and certain Players.

How fares our cousin Hamlet?

I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.

Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

 [_Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio._]

 [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]

 Enter Hamlet.

 Enter Hamlet.

Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

Why, how now, Hamlet?

O Hamlet, speak no more.

No more, sweet Hamlet.

Speak to her, Hamlet.

O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

 [_Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius._]

What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,

 Enter Hamlet.

[_Within._] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.

 Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.

Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?

Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,—

Ay, Hamlet.

Thy loving father, Hamlet.

The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;

 Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern &c.

 [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]

I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.

From Hamlet! Who brought them?

’Tis Hamlet’s character. ’Naked!’

And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality

Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy

Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake

Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home:

 Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.

Hamlet o’ercame Fortinbras.

that young Hamlet was born,—he that is mad, and sent into England.

I hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;

Hamlet the Dane.

Hamlet! Hamlet!

 Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

 [_Hamlet moves him to put on his hat._]

Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

 [_The King puts Laertes’s hand into Hamlet’s._]

Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet.

If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,

Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.

Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d;

His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.

Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,

If Hamlet give the first or second hit,

The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,

‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin.

Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;

Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.

The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

 [_Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and

 Hamlet wounds Laertes._]

No, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!

It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.

Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.

Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,
